# h@rdL!n - Linux Hardening Script

**h@rdL!n** is a bash script designed to automate the process of hardening a Linux system with essential security measures. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced system administrator, this script will help ensure your Linux system is secured through a series of configurable tasks. 

With **h@rdL!n**, you can apply best practices like updating system packages, enforcing password policies, disabling SSH root login, setting up firewalls, and more, all in a gamified manner that tracks your progress with a security score.

## Features
- **Gamified Security Levels:** Each task is part of a level, and you can track your progress with a security score.
- **Automatic & Manual Configurations:** Run specific security measures or apply all levels at once. You can also revert any changes made.
- **Interactive Menu:** Easy-to-use menu to guide you through the hardening process.

## Levels Explained/Key Features

`h@rdL!n` applies progressive security hardening in levels. Each level targets a specific area of Linux system security:

### Level 1: System Update
**Goal:** Ensure the system is using the latest software and security patches.  
**Actions Taken:**
- Runs `apt update` and `apt upgrade -y` to refresh the package list and upgrade all installed packages.  
**Why:** Outdated packages often contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Keeping your system updated is the first line of defense.

---

### Level 2: Password Policy Enforcement
**Goal:** Strengthen password security to resist brute-force or dictionary attacks.  
**Actions Taken:**
- Appends a line to `/etc/pam.d/common-password` to enforce:
  - Minimum password length (`minlen=12`)
  - Minimum difference from previous passwords (`difok=4`)
- Uses the `pam_pwquality` module for complexity enforcement.  
**Why:** Strong, unique passwords are essential for user-level security. This prevents weak credentials from being exploited.

---

### Level 3: Disable SSH Root Login
**Goal:** Prevent direct remote login as the root user via SSH.  
**Actions Taken:**
- Modifies `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to set `PermitRootLogin no`
- Restarts the SSH service to apply changes.  
**Why:** Root access over SSH is a huge security risk. Disabling it forces attackers to breach a lower-privileged account first, reducing attack surface.

---

### Level 4: UFW Firewall Setup
**Goal:** Enable a basic firewall to restrict incoming traffic.  
**Actions Taken:**
- Installs UFW if not present.
- Allows SSH connections.
- Enables the firewall using `ufw --force enable`.  
**Why:** A firewall adds an extra layer of protection by allowing only trusted traffic and dropping everything else.

---

### Level 5: Disable Unused Filesystems
**Goal:** Prevent attackers from loading vulnerable or unnecessary filesystem modules.  
**Actions Taken:**
- Writes rules to `/etc/modprobe.d/disable-filesystems.conf` to disable:
  - `cramfs`, `udf`, `freevxfs`, `jffs2`, `hfs`, `hfsplus`, `squashfs`  
**Why:** If your system doesnâ€™t use these legacy or niche filesystems, disabling them reduces kernel attack surface and speeds up boot time.

---

### Level 6: Enable Automatic Security Updates
**Goal:** Ensure the system automatically installs critical security patches.  
**Actions Taken:**
- Installs `unattended-upgrades` and `apt-listchanges`.
- Configures daily package list updates and automatic upgrades.
- Enables the `unattended-upgrades` systemd service.  
**Why:** Automating security updates reduces human error and ensures fast mitigation of vulnerabilities.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maaroof-Khan/hardLin.git
   cd hardLin-main/src
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x 'h@rdL!n.sh'
   ```

3. **Run the script as root:**
   ```bash
   sudo './h@rdL!n.sh'
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Script
The script provides an interactive menu that allows you to choose which security measures you want to apply or revert. Here's how the menu works:

```bash
[*] Starting: h@rdL!n by Maaroof Khan
[*] Sit back while we harden your Linux *wink* *wink*

[1] - Update system packages
[2] - Enforce Password Policy
[3] - Disable SSH Root Login
[4] - Set up UFW Firewall
[5] - Disable unused filesystems
[6] - Enable automatic security updates
[a] - Apply all levels
[r] - Revert applied tasks
[n] - Apply none

[.] Please choose options (e.g., '1 3 5' or 'r' to revert): 
```

You can:
- **Choose individual tasks** by entering their numbers (e.g., `1 3 5`).
- **Apply all tasks** with the `a` option.
- **Revert any applied changes** with the `r` option.

### Security Score
After applying tasks, the script will show your **security score** based on the number of successful tasks completed. It will provide feedback on how well you've hardened your system:

- **Excellent:** Your system is tightly secured.
- **Good:** Some improvements are possible.
- **Needs Work:** Review failed steps and try again.

## Example

```bash
[*] Starting: h@rdL!n by Maaroof Khan
[*] Sit back while we harden your Linux *wink* *wink*

[1] - Update system packages
[2] - Enforce Password Policy
[3] - Disable SSH Root Login
[4] - Set up UFW Firewall
[5] - Disable unused filesystems
[6] - Enable automatic security updates
[a] - Apply all levels
[r] - Revert applied tasks
[n] - Apply none

[.] Please choose options (e.g., '1 3 5' or 'r' to revert): 1 3 5
```

## Reverting Changes
If you decide to undo any applied security measures, you can use the **Revert** option. The script will guide you through reverting specific tasks, such as:
- Removing password policy configurations
- Enabling SSH root login
- Disabling UFW firewall
- Reverting filesystem hardening
